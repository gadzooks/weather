COASTAL FLOODING...Minor tidal overflow will produce some minor flooding of low lying areas along the shoreline for a couple of hours around high tide. * SOME AFFECTED LOCATIONS...Shorelines around Admiralty Inlet, the Northern Inland Waters, and the Puget Sound including Bellingham, Port Townsend, Oak Harbor, Friday Harbor, Everett, Seattle, Tacoma and Olympia. * TIMING...High tide will occur early Sunday morning. * TIDE INFO...High tides will generally occur during the early morning hours between 5 and 7 AM Sunday. These conditions may return Monday. * IMPACTS...Minor tidal overflow means that water levels will rise to up to a foot above what starts producing flooding along shore lines. Parks and roadways along the shoreline are most likely to be affected.
