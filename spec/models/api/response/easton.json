A series of weather systems will bring periods of low elevation rain and snow to the mountain as well as occasional gusty winds through Christmas Day. The first system will arrive tonight and linger into Sunday. Many winter weather advisories have been issued for this event across the Pacific Northwest. Another system will quickly follow on Monday with more low elevation rain and and mountain snow especially over Oregon. On Christmas Day, scattered snow showers will continue over the mountains. Snow levels will initially be low tonight...around 1500 feet to 3000 feet for most of the forecast area but then rise on Sunday to 3000 to 5000. Even though snow levels will fluctuate between now and Christmas, expect snow to mainly occur above 3000 feet which will impact travel over the mountains and the high Oregon desert plateaus. Gusty winds will also occur this weekend, although wind gusts do not appear to be significant. The strongest winds will likely occur tonight across the mountains of eastern Oregon with gusts up to 40 mph. The main concern with winds will be blowing and drifting of snow and poor visibility. Holiday travelers need to prepare for snow-covered roads and poor visibility. Carry traction devices, shovels, flashlights with good batteries, and cell phone chargers for your vehicle.
