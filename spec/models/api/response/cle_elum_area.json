EXPECTED THIS WEEKEND... .An arctic cold front will bring much colder air into the region late Friday through the weekend. At the same time, an upper level storm system will bring abundant moisture from north to south, with low elevation rain and mountain snow changing over to all snow overnight Friday night. Moderate to heavy mountain snow can be expected over the Cascades and their east slopes and the Blues and Wallowas of northeast Oregon/southeast Washington. In addition, strong northeast winds across the Columbia Basin, Yakima and Kittitas Valleys will lead to areas of blowing and drifting snow late Friday night into Saturday, leading to treacherous travel conditions. Snow should gradually become lighter by Sunday, but extremely cold temperatures will linger on. ...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 5 AM FRIDAY TO 5 PM PDT SATURDAY... * WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 2 to 4 inches below 3000 feet and 4 to 12 inches above 3000 feet. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph with blowing and drifting snow likely at times. * WHERE...Kittitas Valley and East Slopes of the Washington Cascades. * WHEN...From 5 AM Friday to 5 PM PDT Saturday. * IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult, especially in mountain passes.
