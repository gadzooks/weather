COASTAL FLOODING...Minor tidal overflow will produce some minor flooding of low lying areas along the shoreline for a couple of hours around high tide. * SOME AFFECTED LOCATIONS...Shorelines around Admiralty Inlet, the Northern Inland Waters, and the Puget Sound including Bellingham, Port Townsend, Oak Harbor, Friday Harbor, Everett, Seattle, Tacoma and Olympia. * TIMING...High tide will occur early Sunday morning. * TIDE INFO...High tides will generally occur during the early morning hours between 5 and 7 AM Sunday. These conditions may return Monday. * IMPACTS...Minor tidal overflow means that water levels will rise to up to a foot above what starts producing flooding along shore lines. Parks and roadways along the shoreline are most likely to be affected. The threat of beach erosion will be increased.\n","uri":"https://alerts.weather.gov/cap/wwacapget.php?x=WA125ACE93FACC.CoastalFloodAdvisory.125ACEA386E0WA.SEWCFWSEW.97a4763f2bf535d85e44b51d233d98ec"}],"flags":{"sources":["nearest-precip","nwspa","cmc","gfs","hrrr","icon","isd","madis","nam","sref","darksky"],"nearest-station":0.288,"units":"us"},"offset":-8}
