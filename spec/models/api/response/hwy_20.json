SATURDAY... .A late winter storm will deliver snow across the region Friday into Saturday and an Arctic front bringing blustery northerly winds Friday night. Snow will begin to accumulate across north- central Washington as early as Friday morning. Snow will then pick up in intensity by Friday evening as it pushes further east into Idaho by Friday night. The combination of strong northerly winds and fresh snow will result in poor visibility at times down the Okanogan Valley and the Purcell Trench. Winds will spread out across the basin with blowing and drifting snow likely to impact travel, including the evening commute on Friday. ...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM FRIDAY TO 11 AM PDT SATURDAY... * WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 3 to 7 inches valleys and 5 to 10 inches mountains possible. * WHERE...Leavenworth, Mazama, Twisp, Winthrop, Stehekin, Conconully, Blewett Pass, Loup Loup Pass, Stevens Pass, Plain, and Holden Village. * WHEN...From 8 AM Friday to 11 AM PDT Saturday. * IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions.
